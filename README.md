## 👋 About Me

👨‍💻 I'm a **Cloud Engineer** with over **+7 years of experience** designing, building, and managing scalable and resilient cloud infrastructure. While my current focus is on the cloud, I bring a strong **programmer's mindset** to the table – a foundation built since my teenage years coding BASIC on a Casio calculator! This background fuels my passion for automation, efficient problem-solving, and understanding systems at a deep level.

🐧 My journey into infrastructure began around 2009 with the discovery of Linux, leading me to professional system administration and eventually embracing the world of cloud computing and Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

🤖 Since 2023, I've been actively **experimenting with AI**, particularly leveraging APIs and automation to streamline complex or repetitive tasks. I'm fascinated by the potential to integrate intelligent solutions into DevOps workflows and infrastructure management. Exploring MLOps might be the next step in my journey!

## 🚀 My Projects

*   **[Elevator Algorithm](https://github.com/anothercloudguy/Elevators_Demo):** A project that demonstrate a way to address the elevator algorith problem with HTML and JavaScript*
*   **[A DevOps Workshop](https://github.com/anothercloudguy/DevOps-Workshop):** This is a fun end-to-end exercise to practice infrastructure as code and DevOps tools. To create a DEMO app in Python to register unique visitors, store data in PostgreSQL*


*(Due to the nature of my professional work, many projects involve sensitive infrastructure and cannot be shared publicly. The projects shared here are personal experiments and tools.)*

**✨ Tip:** Use GitHub's "Pin repositories" feature on your main profile page to highlight your best work!
